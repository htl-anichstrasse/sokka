\section*{Abstract}

We live in a society where each year an estimate of 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted. A huge part occurs in restaurants with all-you-can-eat buffets or shops that offer buy-one-get-one-free deals on a frequent basis. \cite{depta2018} \\
This diploma project revolves around finding a remedy to mitigate food waste in restaurants and canteens using modern technology.

Sokka aims to resolve part of this major issue by giving customers the opportunity to pre-order their food on the day before just by using their smartphone. This enables chefs to more precisely estimate how much food they need to prepare and hence the number of ingredients that to be purchased.

The result is a fully functioning ordering and payment system with an intuitive user interface for customers and an easy to use control panel for restaurant management.
